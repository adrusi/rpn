# RPN
*An RPN-based language implemented as an interpreter written in javascript.*

To install:

 - Clone the repo
 - Add the repo directory to your PATH

To use:

 - run `$ rpn path/to/script.rpn`

When the language becomes more stable, I will add some documentation.

# Implementations
Currently, RPN runs on both node and narwhal. Node is having problems with reading synchronously from stdin.
